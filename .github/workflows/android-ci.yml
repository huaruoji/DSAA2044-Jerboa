# Events that trigger the workflow
on:
  # Trigger when code is pushed to the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  # Trigger when a Pull Request targets the main branch (recommended best practice)
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# Define one or more jobs
jobs:
  build:
    # Specify the virtual machine environment for this job
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps for the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the code
      # Use the official actions/checkout@v4 to fetch your repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up the JDK environment
      # Android development typically requires a specific version of Java. JDK 17 is the modern standard for Android development
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '17'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      # Step 3: Set up Gradle cache
      # This step is optional but highly recommended! It caches Gradle dependencies,
      # significantly speeding up subsequent builds and saving time and resources.
      - name: Cache Gradle packages
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            ~/.gradle/caches
            ~/.gradle/wrapper
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-${{ hashFiles('**/*.gradle*', '**/gradle-wrapper.properties') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-gradle-

      # Step 4: Add execute permission for gradlew
      # This is a common issue, especially when code is committed from a Windows development environment,
      # where the Linux virtual machine may not have execute permissions.
      - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
        run: chmod +x gradlew

      # Step 5: Build Debug APK using Gradle
      # ./gradlew assembleDebug is the standard command to package a Debug version APK
      - name: Build with Gradle
        run: ./gradlew assembleDebug

      # Step 6: Upload build artifacts (APK file)
      # This step packages and uploads the generated APK file, which you can download after the workflow finishes.
      - name: Upload APK
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          # Name of the uploaded file
          name: Jerboa-Debug-APK
          # Path to the file to be uploaded
          # Note: This is the standard path for Android projects. If the Jerboa project has a custom structure, adjustments may be needed.
          path: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/*.apk
